msgid "Moon Rangers are the ultimate forest warriors. Gifted with tremendous powers channeled from the Moon and by taking extremely hard training, Moon Rangers are able to fight even the deadliest of battles. They are also able to heal nearby allies. All of these warriors are burning with a powerful inner fire, that can be seen to great a distance, but only if they are not concealed by the forest. Moon rangers are the secret enemy of the necromancers, with improved defense against their cold attacks."

msgid "Powerful and well-trained Grey Ranger becomes a Silver Ranger. These warriors are powerful sword-fighters, but are also good at archery. Their weapons are  different from those of Grey Rangers. Silver Rangers use an exotic sword instead of dagger which make them stronger but unable to use the backstab ability. They also have an ability to shoot fire-empowered arrows. Their skills get better at night, especially against cold and pierce attacks."
